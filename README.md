# Linear regression with gradient descent from scratch

In this project I have built a linear regression module using (stochastic) gradient descent from scratch. It implements a mean squared error loss objective function with the possibility to use minibatch gradient descent instead of looking at the entire dataset.

An example usage of the class is shown in the code using the california housing dataset which predicted the output with an R^2 score of ~0.62.
